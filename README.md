# Iris-Classification
This project classifies iris flowers into three species using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. It uses the well-known Iris dataset containing sepal and petal measurements. The model is trained on labeled data and evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics. It's a beginner-friendly example of supervised machine learning in Python.
